                    Orange is an ex-moderator for r/robloxhackers, moderator for r/ROBLOXExploiting, owner of Element, and staff for many more. 
                    He is on this list due to being and doing many things bad, to the point there is a whole group chat with some very well known people in the exploiting scene, where everyone hates orange for things he did or was. 
                    He is the person that lead to me getting fired from the r/ROBLOXExploiting staff team, other innocent people also get banned, negative feedback (CWs) about him getting removed,
                    this website being shut down originally, and a lot more.
                    <br>
                    Here are just some screenshots, to back up this story and show some additional info on how childish, immature and narcisisstic this person is.
                    <br><img src="/assets/dish-ment/groupchat.png" />
                    <p>(The group chat of people, more were in before but some left)<br><br></p>

                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/re-ban-chat.png" />
                    <p>(u/Alkatane being banned from r/ROBLOXExploiting by orange for being a <i>trial</i> mod in r/robloxhackers)<br><br></p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/cw 1.png" />
                    <p><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxhackers/comments/1g19wnp/cw_orange_elements_owner/" target="_blank">(original CW, over at reddit.com/r/robloxhackers)</a></p>
                    <br><img src="/assets/dish-ment/cw-deleted-reddit.png" />
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/orange-deletes-cw.png" />
                    <p>(Orange kept deleting the CW (community warning) against himself by u/Alkatane, for reason "keep it truthful", while it is very much truthful)</p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/cw 2.png" />
                    <p>(Second CW)<br><br></p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/orange-cant-cope.png" />
                    <p>(Orange just can't cope with it)</p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/orange-banned-rh.png" />
                    <p>(Orange got banned from r/robloxhackers. Why can't he banned from r/ROBLOXExploiting too?)<br><br></p>

                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/orange-beg-2.png" />
                    <p>(Just orange childishly begging)<br><br></p>

                    <p>(Straight up lying. They were never friends)<br><br></p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/big-yapping.png" />
                    <p>(Just a big bunch of yapping, another pattern I noticed, he gets very jealous of people that get staff roles quicker than him. For example: Not long after he became mod on r/ROBLOXExploiting, I did too, but I got promoted a few days quicker than him, which made him insane jealous. (Besides, I made a whole website for the subreddit and was around for a while too.))<br><br></p>
                    <img src="/assets/dish-ment/oranges-best-argument-blocking.png" />
                    <p>(Oranges best argument in some situations just seems to be blocking people.)<br><br></p>
                    <p>Also, as a last thing, here is orange pulling a full 180 on me, if not almost manipulating me so that he can get back mod and have power over me..</p>
                    <br><img src="/assets/dish-ment/full 180 pt1.png" />
                    <p><br>Part 1, we argued, getting us both demoted, split left for a bit, orange acts all down and talks about leaving after apologizing, (I did too then), acts like he would definitely get fired (bullshit)</p>
                    <br><img src="/assets/dish-ment/full 180 pt2.png" />
                    <p><br>Part 2, we both got discord moderator roles back after our argument</p>
                    <br><img src="/assets/dish-ment/full 180 pt3.png" />
                    <p><br>Part 3, he got reddit perms back, stopped the being nice completely, did a 180 on me, literally gave me rules on what I am allowed to do if I want to be a mod. Also, rsploits.net always was the official site for r/ROBLOXExploiting, which orange was well aware of, but he still said "will stay the unofficial site", so he could replace rsploits with Element or whatever else he had back then. And then, whenever I literally anywhere mentioned rsploits, I HAD to label it as self-promotion, otherwise orange would constantly delete it (I did not make ANY money off rsploits or anything), and before I posted just like that and no one cared. And it is possible that orange even deleted some of my rsploits.net posts, even when I labeled it as self promotion.<br><br></p>
                    <h4>So, basically, if you have orange on your staff team, our recommendation is to just remove him, it's better for everyone.</h4>
